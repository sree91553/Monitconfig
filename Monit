Installation and Configuration of Monit
About Monit
Monit is a small utility for managing and monitoring Unix systems. Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations.

Install Monit
Monit is easiest to install through YUM

sudo yum install monit
Once monit downloads, you can add programs and processes to the configuration file:

sudo vi /etc/monitrc
Monit can be started up with a command that then keeps it running in the background

service monit start
Typing monit status displays monit’s details:

Configure Monit
Monit is very easy to use nearly out of the box. By default, it is set up to check that services are running every 30 seconds and stores its log file in /var/log/monit.log.

Web Service
Monit comes with it’s own web server running on port 2812. To configure the web interface, find and uncomment the section that begins with set httpd port 2812. Once the section is uncommented, write in your server’s IP or domain name as the address, allow anyone to connect, and then create a monit user and password

set httpd port 2812
  use address hc4t02442.itcs.hpecorp.net  # only accept connection from localhost
  allow 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0        # allow localhost to connect to the server and
  allow admin:monit      # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'
Once this is configured, monit should reload and reread the configuration file, and the web interface will be available:

monit reload
You will then be able to access the monit web interface by going to hc4t02442.itcs.hpecorp.net:2812

Login with your chosen username and password. Your screen should look something.

Configuring Services Self-Monitoring
Once the web services are set up, you can begin to input the programs that you want monitored and protected into the "/etc/monitrc" configuration file. To simply ensure that programs stay online, you can use the /etc/init.d commands to stop or start a program.

Here are some example configurations:

Apache:
check process Apache_Server  with pidfile /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid
    if not exist for 10 cycles then alert
Nginx:
check process nginx with pidfile /var/run/nginx.pid
    if not exist for 10 cycles then alert
Entmon Service [Example entmon-service]
check process entmon-service with pidfile /etc/monit.d/entmonservice.pid
    if not exist for 20 cycles then alert
File System [Example mount1]
check filesystem Mount1 path /opt/mount1
              if space usage > 90% for 20 cycles then alert
Health Check
check host Spark_Dev_Server with address hc4t03891.itcs.hpecorp.net
 if failed url https://hc4t03891.itcs.hpecorp.net:8443/index.htm for 20 cycles then alert
 if failed ping within 20 cycles then alert
 if failed port 22  protocol ssh  within 20 cycles then alert
Finish Up
Once you have set up the configuration, check the syntax:

monit -t
After resolving any possible syntax errors, you can start running all of the monitored programs.

service monit restart
Reference
Refer the Configuration file to get started with the Monit.
